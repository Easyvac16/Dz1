            <center>Romeo and Juliet
        </h1>
        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>Two households, both alike in dignity <br>
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

        <h2>Scene I. Verona. A public place.</h2>
        <p><i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with wards and bucklers</i></strong></p>
        <h2>SAMPSON</h2>
        <p>Gregory, o ' my word, we'll not carry coals .</p>
        <h2>GREGORY</h2>
        <p>No, for then we should be colliers .</p>
